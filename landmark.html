            <h3>St. John the Baptist Chruch</h3>
            <p>Established in 1587 as a visita under the patronage of Saint John the Baptist by the Franciscans, Tabaco became an independent parish in 1664, separating from Cagsaua in 1616. Administered by the Franciscans until 1660, the church's supervision transitioned to the secular clergy from 1750. The current church, built by seculars, was finished in 1879, replacing an older edifice built in 1864. The church, designated as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines, is one of only two such sites in the Bicol Region, with its monument revealed on June 22, 2012. The church is constructed of black volcanic soil and local stones. The existence of mason's markings on stones used in the church's construction, an uncommon phenomenon in the Philippines, is one remarkable element of the church. Its odd floor layout includes chambers for which no explanation is now available. It is famous for its stunning bell tower with rococo embellishments.
