            <h3>Tabak Festival</h3>
            <p>
                This enchanting legend reveals the intriguing origins of Tabaco's name, stemming from             
                The Tabak Festival is an annual celebration in Tabaco City, Albay, marking its founding 
                anniversary and honoring St. John the Baptist, the city's patron saint since Spanish 
                times. Taking place on June 24th, the festival spans two weeks and includes vibrant 
                events like and traditional dances, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Tabaco. 
                The festivities culminate on the feast day of St. John the Baptist, fostering community 
                spirit and expressions of faith. In 2021, Proclamation No. 1164 declared the feast day 
                a special non-working holiday, allowing residents and visitors to fully engage in the 
                celebrations. The festival serves as a unique blend of history, religion, and community 
                pride, creating a tapestry of unity among the people of Tabaco. Through colorful costumes, 
                drumbeats, and prayer, the Tabak Festival has become a cherished tradition that goes 
                beyond commemorating the city's founding, embodying the enduring legacy of Tabaco.

            <p>
                Tabaco, Albay, holds a prominent position as the go-to destination for Bicolandia blades, making it synonymous with the term "Tabak."

Tabaco boasts a diverse array of Tabak variants, including the Wastari, Ginunting Bicol, Machete, Ginogon, and the Minasbad, each crafted with precision by skilled smiths. Visitors with a keen interest in blades can witness the craftsmanship and learn about the cultural significance of these distinctive Tabak variants.
